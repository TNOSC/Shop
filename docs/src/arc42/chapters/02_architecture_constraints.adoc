== Architecture Constraints

This section outlines requirements that impose limitations on the freedom of design and implementation decisions within the development process.

=== Technical Constraints

[cols="10,30,60"]
|===
|  | Constraint | Background and / or motivation

3+|Software and Programming Constraints

^| TC1 | Implementation in C# | The application must be developed using the C# programming language to ensure compatibility with the .NET 8 environment.

^| TC2 | Third-party Software Licensing | All third-party software utilized in the application must be available under an open-source license compatible with the project's requirements. Additionally, it should be installable via a package manager to facilitate seamless integration and updates.

3+|Operating System Constraints

^| TC3 | OS-Independent Development | The application should be designed to be platform-independent, ensuring compatibility with major operating systems such as Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows. This flexibility allows for wider deployment options and increased accessibility for users.

^| TC4 | Linux Server Deployment | To accommodate deployment in various hosting environments, the application must be capable of being deployed on Linux-based servers using standard deployment procedures. This ensures compatibility with common server configurations and facilitates seamless deployment processes.

3+|Hardware Constraints

^| TC5 | Memory Efficiency | Given potential resource constraints in shared or cloud-based hosting environments, the application should prioritize memory efficiency. Optimizing memory usage reduces operational costs and improves overall performance, making the application more scalable and cost-effective.

|  | Conventions | Background and / or motivation

^| C1 | Architecture documentation | Structure based on the english arc42-Template in version 8.2

^| C2 | Language | English. The projecttargets an international audience, so English should be used throughout the whole project.

^| C3 | Naming conventions | The project uses https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/naming-rules[the Code-style name rules provided by micorosoft]. They are checked and enforced with https://github.com/TNOSC/Shop/blob/master/.editorconfig[.editorconfig].
